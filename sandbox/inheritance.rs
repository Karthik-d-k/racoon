Using rust 1.2.0

Problem

I'm still in the process of learning Rust (coming from a Javascript background) and am trying to figure out if it is possible for one struct StructB to extend an existing struct StructA such that StructB has all the fields defined on StructA.

In Javascript (ES6 syntax) I could essentially do something like this...

class Person {
    constructor (gender, age) {
        this.gender = gender;
        this.age = age;
    }
}
class Child extends Person {
    constructor (name, gender, age) {
        super(gender, age);
        this.name = name;
    }
}

Constraints

    StructA is from an external cargo package that I have no control over.

Current Progress

I found this blog post on single-inheritance which sounds like exactly what I need.

But trying to implement it resulted in this error message error: virtual structs have been removed from the language. Some searching later and I found out that it had been implemented and then removed per RFC-341 rather quickly.

Also found this thread about using traits, but since StructA is from an external cargo package I don't think it is possible for me to turn it into a trait.

So what would be the correct way to accomplish this in Rust?

    I think it will always be sub-optimal to answer this question without knowing the context in which you want to use the newly generated struct and why. In my opinion these design decisions highly depend on the specific use-case. â€“

There is nothing that exactly matches that. There are two concepts that come to mind.

    Structural composition

    struct Person {
        age: u8,
    }

    struct Child {
        person: Person,
        has_toy: bool,
    }

    impl Person {
        fn new(age: u8) -> Self {
            Person { age: age }
        }

        fn age(&self) -> u8 {
            self.age
        }
    }

    impl Child {
        fn new(age: u8, has_toy: bool) -> Self {
            Child { person: Person::new(age), has_toy: has_toy }
        }

        fn age(&self) -> u8 {
            self.person.age()
        }
    }

    fn main() {
        let p = Person::new(42);
        let c = Child::new(7, true);

        println!("I am {}", p.age());
        println!("My child is {}", c.age());
    }
